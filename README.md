Each option triggers a specific Python script using the subprocess module, facilitating modular execution. The program employs event-driven programming to handle button clicks and organizes functionality into reusable functions, ensuring clarity and maintainability. A visually appealing GUI is created with features like a logo, menu options, and an exit button, enhancing user experience.
  
  The script demonstrates key Python concepts, including event-driven programming, where user interactions (button clicks) trigger specific actions like opening other modules using the subprocess module. It applies modularity by encapsulating functionality into separate, reusable functions (home_gui for the GUI and handle_choice for navigation logic). Error handling ensures the program responds gracefully to invalid choices. The use of Tkinter showcases GUI development, including layout management, widgets like buttons, and customization of visual elements, reflecting principles of user interface design. The script also highlights code reusability and scalability, enabling easy addition or modification of features.  
  
LrnFreeFall.pf
  
This script uses Tkinter to create an educational graphical user interface (GUI) for learning about free fall concepts. It features a visually appealing design with a gradient background created using a custom function that smoothly transitions between two colors. The GUI includes a title, an image logo, and an informational section about free fall physics, formatted as multiline text displayed in a styled frame. A Back button allows navigation to the home page using the subprocess.Popen method, demonstrating modularity by integrating with another script. The script showcases event-driven programming (user interactions trigger actions like returning to the home page) and layout management for organizing text and visual elements in a clear and user-friendly way. Concepts like modularity, GUI customization, and inter-script communication are applied effectively to enhance the learning experience.

  The concept applied in this script revolves around event-driven programming, modularity, and user-friendly interface design. Event-driven programming is evident in how user actions, such as clicking the "BACK" button, trigger specific functions like navigating to another page. Modularity is achieved by separating functionalities into different scripts (e.g., navigating back to the home page using Home_Page.py), allowing better organization and reusability of code. Additionally, GUI design principles are utilized to create a visually appealing and educational interface, incorporating gradient backgrounds, structured text displays, and clear navigation options. The script emphasizes simplicity and accessibility to enhance user interaction and learning engagement.

HTSFreeFall.py
  
This code uses the tkinter library in Python to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for solving free fall problems. The main window (root) is created, and its title, size, and background color are configured. A custom function, on_back(), is linked to a "Back" button, which closes the current window and opens another script (Home_Page.py). The center_window() function calculates the windowâ€™s position to ensure it's centered on the screen. The window contains a logo, a title label, and a scrollable text area (text_area) for displaying educational content, such as formulas and examples related to free fall problems. Additionally, the Text widget, combined with a scrollbar (ttk.Scrollbar), allows the content to be scrolled if it exceeds the visible area. The text_area is populated with the educational material and set to a disabled state to prevent users from modifying the content.

  This Python code utilizes the tkinter library to create a GUI for teaching free fall physics concepts. It demonstrates several key programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), event-driven programming, and GUI layout management. tkinter is used to create the main window, buttons, labels, and a scrollable text area, providing an interactive educational interface. The on_back() function shows how to handle button clicks to execute actions, like closing the current window and launching a new script. The center_window() function demonstrates basic window positioning by calculating coordinates to center the window on the screen. The Text widget, combined with a Scrollbar, showcases how to display and manage large amounts of text content. Additionally, the use of state=tk.DISABLED in the text area ensures that the user cannot modify the educational content, making it a read-only interface. This project integrates GUI design with interactive content presentation, making it a useful tool for educational purposes.

Problem.py
  
  This Python code uses the tkinter library to create a GUI application for solving free fall physics problems, integrating MySQL to save user results. It leverages event-driven programming by handling focus events to manage placeholder text in input fields and dynamic updates to display one problem at a time. The answers are evaluated based on predefined correct values, and the score is calculated and displayed. The mysql.connector library is used to connect to a MySQL database, where the results (correct or incorrect answers) are saved. The code also uses the subprocess.Popen function to navigate back to a home page after submission. Through navigation buttons like "Next," "Previous," and "Submit," the program guides the user through the problems while providing an interactive educational experience.

  This Python code demonstrates the use of the tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI), event-driven programming, and database integration. It employs tkinter to build a window with interactive widgets such as labels, buttons, and entry fields for solving free fall physics problems. The event-driven approach is applied by binding focus events to input fields, managing user interactions like clearing and restoring placeholder text. The answers are evaluated using conditional logic, and a score is calculated based on the user's input. The mysql.connector library is used to connect to a MySQL database, allowing the program to save the results, including correct or incorrect answers, into a table. The subprocess module facilitates navigation, enabling the program to launch another script (the home page) after submitting results. Through the use of navigation buttons ("Next," "Previous," and "Submit"), the application allows the user to progress through the problems interactively.

Data.py 
  This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter to manage and display user data and results from a MySQL database for the Free Fall Educational Support project. The Treeview widget is used to display data from both the users and results tables, with columns showing details such as user ID, name, date of birth, gender, age, and scores. Users can delete a selected record from both tables, with confirmation provided before deletion. The data is fetched from the database using mysql.connector, and the table is dynamically updated. The program also includes a back button that navigates to the home page of the application. The subprocess module is used to launch the home page script, and the layout is designed to be user-friendly with buttons for navigation and functionality.

  The concept of this script is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing and interacting with user data and their corresponding results within a database for the Free Fall Educational Support project. It enables the display of user and result information using a table-like structure (Treeview), with the ability to delete specific records from both the users and results tables. The program connects to a MySQL database to fetch, display, and manipulate the data. It supports a streamlined process for handling educational records, helping administrators to view and manage the data efficiently. Additionally, the application facilitates seamless navigation to other sections of the project, such as returning to the home page.
